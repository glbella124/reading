Section:

Poskett's main contribution with this book is to demonstrate that "European" knowledge has long been the result of global efforts and that science is **intimately** attached to colonialism, capitalism, slavery, industrialization, and geopolitical conflict.

Poskett offers countless examples of non-European scientists whose research changed the sciences in radical new ways.

Despite these shortcomings, Horizons is nevertheless a challenging book that deserves a wide **readership**.
